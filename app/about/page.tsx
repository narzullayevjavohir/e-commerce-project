          <p className="text-md text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Founded by Narzullayev Javohir in [Year], Furniro started as a small
            team of passionate designers and craftsmen who shared a common goal:
            to redefine the way people think about furniture. Our journey began
            with a single idea â€“ to create furniture that combines aesthetics,
            comfort, and sustainability. Over the years, we have grown into a
            thriving startup, continuously pushing the boundaries of design and
            innovation.
